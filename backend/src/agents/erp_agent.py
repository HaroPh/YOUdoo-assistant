        R7 hotfix (live-verify 2026-07-09): Open WebUI's own background task
        calls (title/tags/follow-up/query generation) share the same chat
        identity as real user turns, so routing them through chat() would
        risk wiping a real parked confirm (main.py's _is_owui_task_prompt
        routes them here instead).

        Deliberately uses the "synthesis" role, NOT "chitchat": Open WebUI's
        task prompts embed recent conversation history to generate relevant
        titles/follow-ups, which may include real ERP data (prices, customer
        names) produced by the read/synthesis roles earlier in the
        conversation.

        Post-SP-1 correction (docstring only — the role choice below is
        unchanged): the mechanism this comment used to cite no longer exists.
        The old models.py enforced CLOUD_ALLOWED = {"router", "evaluator",
        "chitchat"} at the call layer — model_for() failed closed for any
        role outside that set, so "read"/"synthesis" were ALWAYS local by
        construction and "chitchat" was cloud-eligible on the premise it only
        ever saw raw user text. SP-1 removed Ollama from the chat path
        entirely; agents/models.py is now a thin facade over
        llm/router.py (Task 8), and EVERY role — including "chitchat" —
        routes through the same cloud gateway. There is no longer a role that
        is "always local by construction", so the original privacy-boundary
        rationale for preferring "synthesis" here no longer holds as stated.
        "synthesis" is kept anyway because its model chain (catalog.py) is
        tuned for longer, data-bearing completions rather than short
        chitchat replies, which fits Open WebUI's task-prompt payloads
        better — but if a real privacy boundary between roles matters again
        (e.g. once this system carries non-demo data), this choice needs a
        fresh look rather than resting on the stale CLOUD_ALLOWED premise.
